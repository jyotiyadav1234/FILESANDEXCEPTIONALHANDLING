    "1. Discuss the scenarios where multithreading is preferable to multiprocessing and scenarios where multiprocessing is a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is better for I/O-bound tasks such as reading/writing files, network operations, or user input/output where threads spend a lot of time waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is preferred for CPU-bound tasks such as data processing, image manipulation, or complex computations where tasks use a lot of CPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A process pool is a collection of worker processes managed by the multiprocessing.Pool class in Python. It enables efficient distribution of tasks to multiple processes, reusing them instead of creating new ones each time. This reduces overhead and improves performance when handling many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain what multiprocessing is and why it is used in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Multiprocessing allows a Python program to create multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It is used to achieve true parallelism, bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), and is especially useful for CPU-bound operations.\n",
